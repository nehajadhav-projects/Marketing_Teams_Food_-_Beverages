## Project Overview:
The project focuses on understanding the barriers to consumption for CodeX's energy drink, which was recently launched in 10 Indian cities. With survey responses from 10,000 participants, the marketing team seeks insights into why certain segments of the market are hesitant to adopt the product. By analyzing health concerns, desired product improvements, and reasons for not trying the drink, the company can address these barriers and expand its customer base.

## Problem Statement:
-	CodeX faces challenges in gaining traction among certain customer groups.
-	Consumers cite various reasons, such as health concerns, product availability, and lack of awareness, for not purchasing the energy drink.
-	Improvements in the product and its distribution need to align with customer preferences and address concerns to boost market adoption.
